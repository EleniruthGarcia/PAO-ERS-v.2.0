Public Attorney's Office - Electric Records System v1.2.5

## Developing

Make sure to make an `.env` file first based on the `.env.example` with a connection string to a running MongoDB database.

After installing dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
